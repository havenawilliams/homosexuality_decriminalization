# homosexuality_decriminalization
This is the github repository I created for a project I did independently on legalization of same-sex marriage and the decriminalization of homosexuality. The point of the project is to provide a theory for when homosexuality will be criminalized in any country. This repository contains files that support my writing.

#Datasets

There are several datasets in this repository. The write up that I link to below contains citations for these datasets, but I do not recommend that you download them from me. However, the gm_data_fixed2.csv is a novel contribution I have made that you may download freely. The file is a dataset on the legal status of homosexuality throughout all countries that have data on them in Wikipedia. The data were assembled by hand by looking through hundreds of pages, but the source for all of them is Wikipedia.

#The write up

The write up that I did proposes that if a democratic country has 80% internet access, that it will always decriminalize homosexuality. The main justification is that without this level of internet access, homosexuals remain a largely anonymous, discoordinated minority and country leaders find it easier to repress homosexuals than provide them public policy. The reason for this is that discoordinated homosexuals can't coordinate to impose audience costs on leaders. This scenario flips when internet access reaches 80%, past which homosexuals become an influential and coordinated voting bloc that makes public policy more beneficial than repression. The paper further explains the theory in terms of selectorate theory.
